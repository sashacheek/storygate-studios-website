          This is the current main project we are working on: a simple 2D platformer with an emphasis on exploration. Players can explore through worlds, solving small puzzles and discovering more about the world around them. The game is in development presently, and once the mechanics are all worked out, art and music will be added before the main beta release.

          Once the platformer is complete, we will turn our focus to this project, a story-based game with compelling story with multiple possible endings. The player plays as a cyborg who had their memory chip wiped while infiltrating an alien military base. You weave through guards and search for the main weapons control, all while learning more about your past and figuring out who it was that mysteriously wiped your memory disksâ€¦ As you go, you discover that this military base was planning  to launching an attack on your home planet and starting an all-out war, which you must attempt to prevent with the aid of some allies from your planet.
