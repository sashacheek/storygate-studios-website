This Project uses the HTML and CSS code from my WDD 130 Class final project.
Back in that class, I made an empty username and comment form that did nothing
because I didn't know any JavaScript yet. For this project, I added the Javascript
to make the form add a comment. I also added a section for users to create a
username, which must be done to be able to add a comment.
